# Environment configuration example
# Copy this file to `.env` and fill in values.
# Only the variables relevant to the database type you use are required.
#
# For local development with SQLite you can skip the Supabase variables and set:
#   DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
# The SQLite database file defaults to: github_issues.db
#
# For Supabase, set DATABASE_TYPE=supabase (or leave it blank) and provide:
#   SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL, SUPABASE_API_KEY (anon or service key)
#
# Optional improvements / future use:
#   GITHUB_TOKEN can be added to raise GitHub API rate limits (not yet used in code).
#
# After editing, run:
#   make fetch-sqlite   (to populate SQLite)
#   make fetch-supabase (to populate Supabase)
###############################################

# ========== Database Mode Selection ==========
# Choose which backend to use: "sqlite" or "supabase".
# If empty or anything else than "sqlite", Supabase is attempted.
DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite

# ========== Supabase Configuration (required if DATABASE_TYPE is not 'sqlite') ==========
# The base URL of your Supabase project (found in Project Settings -> API)
SUPABASE_PROJECT_URL=

# The API key (anon public key is fine for basic upsert operations; service_role for elevated operations)
SUPABASE_API_KEY=

# Optional: Project password / service role secret (only if you intend to use it elsewhere securely)
SUPABASE_PROJECT_PASSWORD=

# ========== Optional GitHub Settings ==========
# Personal Access Token (classic or fine-grained) to increase rate limits.
# Currently NOT consumed by the code; add support in code before relying on it.
GITHUB_TOKEN=

# ========== Operational Tweaks (Makefile runtime) ==========
# These are NOT read by the Python code directly today, but you can export them
# before calling make to override pagination when we add support:
#   export PAGES=3
#   export PER_PAGE=25
# They are passed through by the Makefile and can be wired into code in the future.
PAGES=
PER_PAGE=

# ========== Notes ==========
# Ensure you keep your real `.env` file out of version control.
# GitHub token, service keys, and passwords are secretsâ€”never commit them.
